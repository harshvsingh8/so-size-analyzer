* So  Size Analyzer

A python tool to analyze space usages of symbols in a .so file.

** Usage:

`python so_size_analyzer.py <path_to_so_file> <maxsymbols>`

As, the following lists top 100 most space consuming symbols in the
libnative.so

`so_size_analyzer libnative.so 100`

/NOTE/: Use debug version of so to the full symbol details.

/NOTE/: Ensure that c++filt is found in the PATH so that the script
spits out the un-mangled symbol names.
